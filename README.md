# 1D_Two_Stage_Bin_Packing_Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of various algorithms for solving the bin packing problem. The following algorithms are included:  

## Item-centric algorithms. 

Item-centric algorithms pack items into bins using FFD or BFD or WFD bin packing algorithms.

## Multi-bin algorithms. 

## Two-stage algorithms.
