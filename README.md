# 1D_Two_Stage_Bin_Packing_Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of three classes of algorithms for solving the one dimensional bin packing problem. The following algorithms are included:  

## Item-Centric algorithms. 

Item-centric algorithms pack items sequentially into bins selected accroding to the algorithm.
FF, FFD, BF, BFD, WF, WFD are some examples of Item-Centric algorithms.

## Multi-Bin Pairing algorithms. 

Given a m number of bins and n number of items, this class of algorithms attempt to find the smallest m such that all items are packed into bins.
Two types of Multi-Bin Pairing algorithms have been implemented.

## Two-stage algorithms.  
This class of algorithms apply one of Item-Centric or Mult-Bin Pairing algorithms in the first stage and another algorithm in the second stage.
